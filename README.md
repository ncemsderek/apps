## Changelog

### v1.9
- Firebase live: projectId ncems-hub-9111d
- FIREBASE_READY = true in both index.html and admin.html
- Admin password updated to Ncems911
- Usage tracker live: bumps hub open count in Firestore (usage/hub) with daily breakdown
- Notice listener active: crew hub updates in real time when admin pushes a notice
- Monthly usage email report still pending (Google Apps Script — future session)

### v1.8
- Added a line to the info panel: apps open in a Safari window; for full-screen, add them to the home screen individually
- jsdom smoke test: 5/5 pass

### v1.7
- Notice banner: smaller (38px), white centered text, tap it to expand the full notice in a popup
- Info panel now reads "contact Doug" and the email opens with subject line "NCEMS HUB APP"
- Ops access code (5142) resets every 2 hours, and re-locks when the app returns to foreground past that window
- Added manifest.json for clean standalone app-mode launch from the home screen
- NOTE on app mode: links to other apps open in an iOS Safari sheet, not full-screen — that's an iOS rule the hub can't override. Each app runs full-screen only when added to the home screen on its own.
- jsdom smoke test: 15/15 pass

### v1.6
- Removed swipe. Bottom tab bar now: Clinical (default) | Operations
- Operations tab locked with code 5142 — unlocks once, stays unlocked until the app fully closes
- Operations holds Incident Report, NCEMS OT, WAMBOchecker
- (i) info button top-right of header — credits Doug with a one-line note and a tap-to-email link (d.boyce@northcountryems.org)
- NOTE: 5142 lives in page source — placeholder gate only. Move to Firebase Auth for real protection (planned)
- jsdom smoke test: 20/20 pass

### v1.5
- Clinical + Quick Protocols cards now use the Intubation Guide's button style: tall forest-green gradient cards, big bold uppercase SF Mono titles, press-to-scale, no confirm on tap
- Ops/Apparatus buttons (Incident Report, NCEMS OT, WAMBOchecker) match the same family
- Coming Soon cards use a muted version of the same button shape
- SF Mono set as the hub's base font to match the clinical apps
- jsdom smoke test: 12/12 pass

### v1.4
- NCEMS round logo in header, iOS home-screen icon, and favicon
- Removed all emoji icons (the source of the garbling) — clean text + logo only
- Resized logo to web-friendly PNG (was a 2.5 MB / 3375px JPEG)
- Hardened swipe script for older iOS Safari
- jsdom smoke test: 12/12 pass

### v1.3
- Two swipe pages; clinical big-word cards; Quick Protocols separate section

### v1.2
- Full hub rebuild; admin notice banner; admin.html with login

### v1.1
- Config-driven APPS list; added NCEMS OT

### v1.0
- First build

## Notes

- Hosted in `apps` repo — never touches root URL
- iOS home-screen caches hard — delete and re-add icon after every deploy
- Each individual app still needs its own back button to `https://ncemsderek.github.io/apps/`
